# EnCryptor - Your Ultimate Text Encryption Tool

Welcome to EnCryptor, an exceptional text encryption and decryption program that employs the power of Caesar and Vigenere ciphers to safeguard your messages from prying eyes. Developed by Jeffin Tom for CST8132 Object Oriented Programming, this program is designed to make encryption easy and accessible.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Encrypt your messages with a simple shift-based cipher. Choose your custom shift value for added security.

- **Vigenere Cipher**: For more advanced encryption, use the Vigenere cipher with a password of your choice.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and straightforward menu-driven interface for easy navigation.

- **Message Storage**: Save and manage your encrypted messages in a list for later decryption.

## Getting Started

To get started with EnCryptor, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile and run the program using your preferred Java development environment.

3. Choose from the main menu whether you want to encrypt text, decrypt text, display your encrypted list, or exit the program.

4. For encryption, select your desired method (Caesar or Vigenere) and follow the prompts.

5. For decryption, provide the message number to decrypt, and the program will do the rest.

6. To view your encrypted list, simply select the "Display encrypted list" option.

7. Exit the program when you're done.
